# Player menu harness

The redesign's player menu (`Redesigned/Player/PlayerMenu.x`, drawn by `SGRPlayerMenu.m`) run for real over
a mock of Spotify's context menu sheet: a player with its ⋯ (`id=Context menu`), and the sheet presented from
it the way 9.1.78 nests it, whose rows are controls carrying the item's number as their accessibility
identifier. Share (9) pushes a page onto the sheet, Lyrics (28) turns itself on in place, every other row
dismisses the sheet. Speed and pitch are stubs that log.

    THEOS=$HOME/theos ./build.sh
    xcrun simctl install <udid> build/PlayerMenuHarness.app
    xcrun simctl launch --console-pty <udid> com.vojta.playermenuharness [hold|more|speed|follow|tile|share|lyrics|outside|pending] [loading|slow|stuck] [differ] [trace] [dump] [dimmings]

Every run taps the ⋯ at 1 s and reports the card, its rows top to bottom and whether Spotify's sheet is out
of sight at 2.2 s; the scenario then taps something on the card at 3 s and reports again. From the tap on,
every frame for a second is checked for Spotify's sheet, its dimming or a system UIDimmingView showing
(`flash check`). `loading` hands the sheet its rows 1.5 s after it is up and `slow` 7 s after; `stuck` never
does, and the card stays either way. `pending` taps Add to playlist on the last run's rows before Spotify's are
in: with `loading` it is fired once they are, with `stuck` Spotify's sheet is shown 4 s after the tap. `dump` logs the presentation's container, `dimmings` where the system's UIDimmingViews are and whether
they are hidden.

`differ` gives the sheet another track's rows than the ones the last run kept (no Remove from this playlist,
Lyrics on), so with `loading` or `slow` the card has to move from the kept rows to these. `trace` logs, every
frame from the tap, the card's scale, its rows' alpha and the first row's frame whenever they change: that is
how the open and a change of rows are checked for animation, since the simulator's screen recordings keep no
reliable timing.

`quick` stretches the mock sheet's presentation to 1.5 s and fires the menu's close callback while it
is still presenting. It asserts that no hidden modal remains, the sheet's mask and interaction are
restored, and another menu can open and close. Add `reuse` to present the same sheet and menu again:

    xcrun simctl launch --console-pty <udid> com.vojta.playermenuharness quick reuse

Add `quickpick` to select Add to playlist during presentation instead of closing without a pick.
