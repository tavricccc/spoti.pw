// Player redesign: the lyrics come to the player itself, the way the Music app shows them. The player
// is one screen and does not scroll (PlayerScroll.x), so the footer's lyrics glyph is the only way to
// them: it shrinks the cover into a thumbnail at the top of the artwork band, lifts the track's title
// up beside it, and fades the Apple Music style lines (Redesigned/Lyrics/SGRKaraokeView.h) into the
// room that frees between the title and the progress bar. Tapping it again, or the thumbnail, puts the
// cover back. Over a clip (PlayerAnimated.x), where the player shows no cover, the thumbnail comes up and
// goes where it sits instead.
//
// Nothing of Spotify's is taken apart for it. The cover is the Kit's now playing artwork drawn again
// in a view of the redesign's own, flown from where Spotify's cover is drawn to where the thumbnail
// belongs, while Spotify's list of covers goes to alpha 0 underneath: one view to move instead of a
// paging list of them, and the two pictures are the same one, so the swap is not seen. The title row
// is Spotify's own unit translated, the way PlayerFooter.x moves the footer's controls -- a transform
// survives the stack view laying its arranged views out again -- with a mask over it where the controls
// it moved towards begin, so a long title fades out before them instead of running under them. The row
// of chips over it (Switch to video) goes while the lines are up, since they take the room it sits in.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/player/01.txt): SPTNowPlayingView (:26) holds the content layers, the header row
// (:91), and id=npv.bottomStackView {0, 576.67, 402, 236} (:127) whose arranged views are the
// information unit {0, 0, 402, 64} (:160, the title, the artist and the add button), the duration unit
// {0, 64, 402, 40} (:209), the controls (:240) and the footer (:295). The title is
// id=now-playing-title-label and the artist id=now-playing-subtitle-label (:174, :185), both inside one
// arranged element view {12, 2.33, 304, 43.33} of the unit's row. Every measurement here is taken from
// the views themselves, since a player with a volume row or another mode's units has other numbers.
//
// The geometry is re-applied on every layout pass of the units, since a new track rebuilds the
// elements inside them, and it is undone before the player closes: the bar morphs back into a full
// size cover, which a thumbnail would not match.
//
// With the lines up and the song playing, the controls go after a few seconds untouched and the lines
// have the player to themselves, the way the Music app leaves its lyrics alone: the header row, the
// thumbnail and the bottom stack (the lifted title row with it) fade out, and the lines' room grows
// from the band between the title row and the progress bar to the whole height of the player. The
// lines' view is laid over all of that room from the start and only its band moves
// (SGRKaraokeView's lineInsets), so the lines spring to the new anchor as they move on to a new line,
// rather than riding a view resized under them. A touch anywhere on the player brings the controls
// back, and a tap that does so does only that: it does not seek to the line under it. Pausing brings
// them back as well, and they stay while the song is paused. VoiceOver keeps them.
//
// With Sing available (Shared/Sing: switched on in Mod Settings > Karaoke, its voice model downloaded), its
// microphone (Redesigned/Lyrics/SGRSingControl.h) sits in the bottom trailing corner of the lines' band,
// opposite their own glass button, and goes down with the band when the controls go. While it is open,
// preparing or explaining itself the controls do not go, but ones that are away already stay away: a
// touch on the microphone is for it and brings nothing back, since the band it sits in would move it out
// from under the finger. The lines open with Sing available even for a song without lyrics, so the
// microphone can always be reached; switched off, or without its model, there is no microphone and a song
// without lyrics keeps its cover. Both follow the switch and the model as they change.
