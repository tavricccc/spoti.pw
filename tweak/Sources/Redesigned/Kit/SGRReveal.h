// A redesigned page coming in whole. Spotify fills a playlist, an album or an artist in pieces -- the cover
// straight away from the card that was tapped, the controls when its buttons arrive, the tracks once their
// rows have data -- and the redesign drew each piece as it came, so the page arrived in three steps.
//
// A short curtain covers the first layout pass, then yields once the controls and list are ready.
// Artwork and its palette load independently; neither delays access to the page. The
// page fades in from behind it: the field brightens out of the black into the page's colour, and the picture,
// the header and the list fade in over it where they are. The system's
// navigation bar is not in the page, so the back button is there throughout. What arrives after that comes
// in the way it always did.
//
// A page says what it waits for as parts, and the hook that sees a part arrive marks it. A page that has not
// got every part within SGRRevealCap of the curtain going up is shown as it is. A curtain nothing claims with
// its parts within a moment is lifted then: the album's template also builds a podcast's episode page, and an
// artist without a photo has a header the redesign does not lay out, and neither ever gets its parts.
//
// Ownership: the curtain and what the page is waiting for belong to the page (an associated object).
// Threading: main thread only.
